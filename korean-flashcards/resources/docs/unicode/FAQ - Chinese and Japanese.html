      <p class="q"><a name="A"></a>Q: What does the term "CJK" mean?</p>
      <p class="a">A: It is a commonly used acronym for "Chinese, Japanese, and Korean". The term "CJK character" generally refers to
   "Chinese characters", or more specifically, the Chinese (= Han) ideographs used in the writing systems of the Chinese and Japanese languages, occasionally for Korean, and historically in Vietnam.</p>
      <p class="q"><a name="B"></a>Q: Are Chinese characters used in Korean?</p>
      <p class="a">A: Yes, but mostly for older and traditional literary materials. Modern Korean is written almost entirely with a separate system of Hangul characters constructed of smaller pieces called jamo letters.  </p>
      <p class="q"><a name="C"></a>Q: Where can I find out more about Hangul and jamo characters for Korean?</p>
      <p class="a">A: There is a separate <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/korean.html">FAQ on Korean</a> dealing with Hangul and jamo characters.</p>
      <p class="q"><a name="0"></a>Q: I have heard that UTF-8 does not support 
      some Japanese characters. Is this correct?</p>
      <p class="a">A: There is a lot of misinformation floating around about the 
      support of Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) characters. The Unicode 
      Standard supports <b>all </b>of the CJK characters from JIS X 0208, JIS X 
      0212, JIS X 0221, or JIS X 0213, for example, and many more. This is true 
      no matter which encoding form of Unicode is used: UTF-8, UTF-16, or 
      UTF-32.</p>
		<p class="a">Unicode supports over 80,000 CJK characters right now, and work is 
      underway to encode further additions. The International Standard ISO/IEC 
      10646 and the Unicode Standard are completely synchronized in repertoire 
      and content. And that means that Unicode has the same repertoire as GB 
      18030, since that also is synchronized with ISO 10646 — although with a 
      different ordering
      and byte format. </p>
      <p class="q"><a name="1"></a>Q: Who is responsible for future CJK 
      characters?</p>
      <p class="a">A: The development and extension of the CJK characters is 
      being done by the Ideographic Research Group (IRG), which includes 
      official representatives of China, Hong Kong (SAR), Macao (SAR), 
      Singapore, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, plus a 
      representative from the Unicode consortium. For more information, see the
		<a href="http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/">IRG home page</a>. </p>
      <p class="a">The IRG is very carefully cataloging, reviewing, and 
      assessing CJK characters for inclusion into the standard. The only real 
      limitation on the number of CJK characters in the standard is the ability 
      of this group to process them, because the characters are increasingly 
      obscure (no person knows more than a fraction of 
      the set already encoded). </p>
      <p class="q"><a name="1a"></a>Q: What is the process for proposing new CJK unified ideographs?</p>
      <p class="a">A: Newly proposed CJK unified ideographs are first submitted to the <a href="http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/">IRG</a> through national bodies or liaison organizations, and are then assembled into a new "IRG Working Set" that goes through several rounds of detailed review and scrutiny before being approved for standardization as a new CJK unified ideographs extension. Individuals who wish to propose the encoding of new CJK unified ideographs are encouraged to work with their respective country's national body.</p>
      <p class="q"><a name="2"></a>Q: Does the Unified Han character encoding in 
      Unicode mean that I only need one CJK font for Asia, or do I have to allow 
      for choices between different styles of CJK fonts for different countries?</p>
      <p class="a">A: Broadly speaking, there are four traditions for character 
      shapes in East Asia: traditional Chinese (used primarily in Taiwan, Hong 
      Kong, and overseas Chinese communities), simplified Chinese (used 
      primarily in mainland China and Singapore), Japanese, and Korean. Using a 
      single font for all four locales allows the characters to be legible, but 
      means that some characters may look odd. For optimal results a system 
      localized for use in Japan, for example, should use a font designed 
      explicitly for use with Japanese, rather than a generic Unihan font.
      <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#JJ">[JJ]</a></p>
      <p class="q"><a name="3"></a>Q: If the character shapes are different in 
      different parts of East Asia, why were the characters unified?</p>
      <p class="a">A: The Unicode Standard is designed to encode characters, not 
      glyphs. Even where there are substantial variations in the standard way of 
      writing a character from locale to locale, if the fundamental identity of 
      the character is not in question, then a single character is encoded in 
      Unicode.</p>
      <p class="a">This principle applies to East Asian scripts as well as to 
      those of other parts of the world. It is well-recognized that the Han <i>
      characters</i> involved are the same, even when used in different 
      countries to write different languages. In the overwhelming majority of 
      cases where a Han character is written differently in different locales, 
      readers from one locale would recognize the form used in another; in all 
      cases, experts from throughout East Asia would recognize the fundamental 
      unity of the character.</p>
      <p class="a">As a rule, the differences in writing style between the 
      different East Asian locales are within the general range of allowable 
      differences within each typographic tradition. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <p class="a" align="left">E.g., the official "Taiwanese" glyph for 
        草 U+8349 ("grass") per ISO/IEC 10646 uses four strokes for the "grass" 
        radical, whereas the PRC, Japanese, and Korean glyphs use three. As it 
        happens, Apple's LiSung Light font for Big Five (which follows the 
        "Taiwanese" typographic tradition) uses three strokes, as shown here:<font size="6"><sub> 
		<img border="0" src="./FAQ - Chinese and Japanese_files/U8349.gif" width="32" height="26" alt="U8349">&nbsp;</sub></font></p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="a">Japanese users prefer to see Japanese text written with 
      "Japanese" glyphs. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <p class="a">There are occasional instances of unified characters whose 
        typical Chinese glyph and typical Japanese glyph are distinct enough 
        that the Chinese glyph will be unfamiliar to the typical Japanese 
        reader, e.g., 直 U+76F4. To prevent legibility problems for Japanese 
        readers, it is advisable to use a Japanese-style font when presenting 
        Unihan text to Japanese readers. </p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="a">It is also typical for Japanese users to see Chinese text 
      written with "Japanese" glyphs. For example: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <p class="a">A standard Japanese dictionary which quotes Chinese authors 
        (e.g., Mencius) uses "Japanese" glyphs, not Chinese ones. </p></li>
        <li>
        <p class="a">In particular, it is perfectly acceptable within Japanese 
        typography for stretches of Chinese quoted in a predominantly Japanese 
        text to be written with "Japanese" glyphs.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="a">Han Unification is designed to preserve legibility. Documents 
      typically can be simply displayed in the font preferred by the user. Where
       a distinction in style needs to be made (for example, Chinese-style vs. 
       Japanese-style glyphs in the same document), appropriate fonts should be 
       applied to the specific text as needed.</p>
       <p class="a">Because of limitations in existing fonts, it may occasionally happen
that a rare kanji will be displayed using a Chinese-style glyph where
a Japanese-style glyph would be preferred.  This is a font issue, not
a character encoding issue, and the same problem can occur with other
character encoding standards.</p>

      <p class="q"><a name="4"></a>Q: How can I recognize from the 32 bit value of 
      a Unicode character if this is a Chinese, Korean or Japanese character? </p>
      <p class="a">A: It's basically impossible and largely meaningless.  It's the equivalent 
of asking if "a" is an English letter or a French one.  There are 
<i>some</i> characters where one can guess based on the source information 
in the Unihan Database that it's traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, 
Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, but there are too many exceptions to 
make this really reliable.  </p>
      <p class="a">The phonetic data in the Unihan Database should not be used for this purpose.  A 
        blank in the phonetic data means that nobody's supplied a reading, not 
        that a reading doesn't exist.  Because updating the Unihan Database is an 
        ongoing process, these fields will be increasingly filled out as time goes on, 
        but they should never be taken as absolutely complete. In particular, there are 
        obscure characters where it is known that there <i>is</i> a reading, but since the character does not occur in 
        standard dictionaries, we are unable to supply it (e.g., 䃟 U+40DF in 
        Cantonese).</p>
<p class="a">A better solution is to look at the text as a whole:  if there's a fair 
  amount of kana, it's probably Japanese, and if there's a fair amount of 
  hangul, it's probably Korean.</p>

<p class="a">The only proper mechanism is, as for determining whether "chat" is 
spelled correctly in English or French, is to use a higher-level 
protocol.&nbsp;

      <p class="q"><a name="6"></a>Q: Why is Unicode missing some characters 
      from the Big Five character set?</p>
      <p class="a">A: The "Big Five" character set is an industrial standard 
      commonly used for traditional Chinese. There are, however, several 
      versions of the Big Five in common use, generally representing extensions 
      of the formal standard. There are two main versions, "plain Big Five" and 
      "ETEN Big Five" as well as numerous vendor- or platform-&nbsp; specific 
      extensions. In recent years, there have been further extensions such as 
      the Hong Kong Extension to Big Five and Big Five Plus.</p>
      <p class="a">The initial, un-extended Big Five was the standard version of 
      the character set at the time that the Unicode Standard, Version 1.0, was 
      under development, and Unicode was designed to cover its ideographic 
      repertoire completely. This is reflected in the data files supplied by the 
      Unicode Consortium. Some vendors provide vendor-specific tables showing 
      mapping data for their custom Big Five extensions and Unicode. The Unicode 
      Consortium does not, however, provide data on every known dialect of the 
      Big Five, so it is possible that a particular dialect of the Big Five is 
      not included in the tables provided by Unicode.
      <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#JJ">[JJ]</a> </p>
		<p class="q"><a name="7"></a>Q. I hear that certain characters from the GB18030 encoding are not mapped to any code points in Unicode, 
		and need to be mapped to characters in the Private Use Area instead. Is this true? And if so, is the issue being dealt with in the near future?</p>
			<p class="a">A. That used to be true, as of Unicode 4.0. There were in fact a small number of characters in GB 18030 that had not made it into 
			Unicode (and ISO/IEC 10646). However, to avoid having to map characters to the PUA for support of GB18030, the missing characters were added as of 
			Unicode 4.1, so of course they are also in Unicode 5.0 and later versions.</p>
			<p class="a">You can find the characters in question in Annex C (p. 92) of GB 18030-2000. All now have regular Unicode characters. 
			These can be found in the ranges: U+31C0..U+31CF (for CJK strokes) and U+9FA6..U+9FBB (for various CJK characters and components).</p>
      <p class="q"><a name="8"></a>Q: Isn't it true that some Japanese can't write their own names in Unicode?</p>
      <p class="a">A: There are some situations where an individual prefers their 
      name be written with a specific glyph, as in the West we have John and Jon, 
      Mark and Marc, Cathy and Kathy. In most cases, variation sequences in the 
      <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr37/">UTS# 37 Unicode Ideographic Variation Database</a> can be used to provide the required 
      representation in plain text. In other cases, the variant forms have been 
      encoded in Unicode as distinct characters. The IRG also may consider where 
      the encoding of new variant characters is justified.</p>

<p class="a">It should be noted that this is not a problem of Han unification per
se, as it is often represented.  Unicode is a superset of the major
Japanese character encoding standards.  The various JIS standards and
ISO 2022-based encodings have the same limitation. <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#JJ">[JJ]</a>		</p>
<p class="q"><a name="9"></a>Q: Where can I find a Unicode mapping for 
  EACC?</p>
      <p class="a">A: EACC is an American National Standard, East Asian 
      Character Code for Bibliographic Use (ANSI/NISO Z39.64), developed by the 
      library community. The Library of Congress specifies use of EACC for CJK 
      data in MARC 21 records that do not use UTF-8. The Unicode-EACC mapping 
      approved by the MARBI Committee of the American Library Association is 
      available on the
      <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/specchareacc.html">MARC 21 
      Web site</a>. <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#JA">[JA]</a></p>
      <p class="q"><a name="10"></a>Q: Why doesn't the Unihan database include 
      mappings for all EACC characters?</p>
      <p class="a">A: The Unihan database covers only the ideographs in the 
      Unicode Standard. EACC also includes characters such as Japanese kana and 
      Korean hangul that are outside the scope of the Unihan database.
      <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#JA">[JA]</a> </p>
      <p class="q"><a name="11"></a>Q: What is JIS X0213?</p>
      <p class="a">A: JIS X0213, 7-bit and 8-bit double byte coded extended Kanji 
      sets for information interchange, is a new Japanese national standard coded
       character set established by JISC (Japanese Industrial Standards Committee).
        It was established in January 2000, then revised in February 2004. It 
        enumerates 11,233 characters, which extends the 4,344 characters of the 
        JIS X0208 standard. It consists of 10,050 Kanji (ideographic) characters 
        and 1,183 non-Kanji (non-ideographic) characters. These characters are 
        arranged in two planes of a 94-row-by-94-cell matrix. Also, as an informative 
        annex, three encoding methods are defined as extensions of existing de facto 
        encodings, that is, Shift JIS, EUC-JP, and ISO-2022-JP.

      <p class="q"><a name="12"></a>Q: How is JIS X0213 related to some existing 
      JIS standards?</p>
      <p class="a">A: There are several JIS coded character set standards. JIS 
      X0201 is the single-byte coded character set which adapts the ISO/IEC 646 
      standard in Japan. JIS X0208, JIS X0212 and JIS X0213 are the double-byte 
      coded character sets, and JIS X0221 is the multi-byte coded character set 
      which corresponds to ISO/IEC 10646. JIS X0208 is the primary double-byte 
      coded character set used for Japanese. Although both JIS X0212 and JIS 
      X0213 Kanji standards have been established as the supplement to JIS X0208 
      standard, the scopes of their source character sets are different.
      <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#TO">[TO]</a> </p>
      <p class="q"><a name="13"></a>Q: How is JIS X0213  related to Unicode / ISO/IEC 
      10646?</p>
      <p class="a">A: Almost all characters in JIS X0213 have corresponding 
      characters in Unicode / ISO/IEC 10646. Only a few non-Kanji characters are 
      represented by composite sequences in Unicode / ISO/IEC 10646. Kanji 
      characters are mapped to one of the blocks of CJK Unified Ideographs, CJK 
      Compatibility Ideographs, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, or CJK 
      Unified Ideographs Extension B in Unicode 4.0 (or later versions) and 
		corresponding versions of ISO/IEC 10646; or are mapped to CJK 
      Compatibility Ideographs. <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#TO">[TO]</a> </p>

		<li><p class="a" align="left">Shift-JIS byte 0x5C can be mapped to U+005C or U+00A5, which are different, 
		unrelated characters with unrelated glyphs.</p></li>
		<li><p class="a" align="left">Shift-JIS bytes &lt;0x81 0x5C&gt; can be mapped to U+2014 or U+2015, 
		which look almost the same.</p></li>
		<li><p class="a" align="left">Shift-JIS bytes &lt;0x87 0x82&gt; and &lt;0xFA 0x59&gt; can
		both be mapped to U+2116, 
		but the primary roundtrip mapping may be different between platforms. 
		That is, what U+2116 maps back to may be different.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p class="a">Sometimes the standard is ill defined, and each vendor has 
		a choice in how to implement the Unicode mapping table. Examples include 
		the Big5-HKSCS and several other codepages. Sometimes the mapping table 
		varies, even on the same platform. For example, Windows-950 is either 
		Big5 or Big5-HKSCS, and the later one depends on the user applying a 
		Windows specific patch. Implementations of ISO 2022 encodings like 
		ISO-2022-JP differ not only in the mapping tables for the sub-encodings 
		but also in the supported sets of escape sequences and their invocation 
		pattern.</p>
		<p class="a">The W3C has an extensive technical report "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/japanese-xml/">XML

		<p class="q"><a name="16"></a>Q: Why doesn't the Unicode Standard adopt a compositional model for encoding Han ideographs?  
		Wouldn't that save a large number of code points?</p>
		<p class="a">A: The Han ideographic script is largely compositional in nature. The overwhelming number of characters created over 
		the centuries (and still being coined) are made by adjoining two or more old characters in simple geometric relationships. For example, 
		the Cantonese-specific character U+55F0 嗰 was created by adjoining the two older characters, U+53E3 口 and U+500B 個, one next to the other.</p>
		<p class="a">The compositional nature of the script—and, more to the point, the fact that this compositional nature is well-known—means that over time tens of thousands of ideographs have been created, and these are currently encoded in Unicode by using one code 
		point per ideograph. The result is that over 80,000 code points are used for ideographs in the Unicode Standard—over two-thirds of 
		the characters encoded.</p>
		<p class="a">The compositional nature of the script makes it attractive to propose a compositional encoding model, such as can be used 
		for Hangul.  Such a mechanism would result in the savings of thousands of code points and relieve the IRG from the burden of having to 
		examine potential candidates for encoding.</p>
		<p class="a">Unfortunately, there are some difficulties involved with a compositional model for Han.</p>
		<p class="a">First of all, while the rules for drawing composed Jamos as 
		Hangul syllables are relatively straightforward, those for Han 
		are surprisingly complex.  To use U+55F0 嗰 as an example again, although it is built structurally out of two pieces, the left piece 
		occupies far less than 50% of the character's horizontal space.  This reduction in size is a result of the nature of U+53E3 口 itself and 
		doesn't apply to other characters.  Either the rendering process would have to be sophisticated enough to take such ideographic idiosyncrasies 
		into account, or the encoding model would have to provide more information than just the geometric relationship between the composing pieces.
		(This is the main reason why the existing Ideographic Description Sequence mechanism is inadequate even for drawing described ideographs.)</p>
		<p class="a">Even more difficult is the problem of normalization, which would be necessary for operations such as comparison or searching. 
		A normalization algorithm would first have to parse the sequence of composing Han for validity, and then make sure that all substrings are 
		normalized.  It should also to be able to recognize a "canonical" form for a sequence of composing Han.  Thus, U+55F0 嗰 could be spelled 
		using three pieces (U+53E3 口, U+4EBB 亻, U+56FA 固) as well as with two.  Indeed, since U+4EBB 亻 is a well-known variant form of U+4EBA
		人, it could be spelled using that character, as well.  Providing a canonical representation would have to take these multiple spellings into account.</p>
		<p class="a">The open-ended nature of the script and possibilities for ambiguous spelling make it virtually impossible to guarantee that two characters 
		made up by two different people would be treated as equivalent even if they look exactly the same and are intended to be equivalent.</p>
		<p class="a">Other computer processes such as machine-based translation or text-to- speech would probably have to skip such characters when they 
		occur in plain text, because there is no simple, authoritative way for these processes to be able to determine even approximate definitions or 
		pronunciations from the visual representation alone. Even if the data are available, the need to parse strings of variable length before looking 
		them up creates complications.</p>
		<p class="a">Finally, East Asian governments, while aware of the compositional nature of the script, do not wish to actively encourage the coining 
		of new forms because of the practical problems they create.  In particular, new coinages are rarely an aid to communication, since they have no obvious 
		inherent meaning or pronunciation.  They are little more than dingbats littering otherwise intelligible text.</p>
		<p class="a">While the number of encodable ideographs has proven far greater than Unicode had originally anticipated, the standard is in no danger 
		of running out of room for them any time soon.  80,000 ideographs encoded in 25 years amounts to just over 3,200 ideographs per year.  At this rate, 
		it would take over 250  years to fill up the available space in Unicode with ideographs.</p>
		<p class="a">And while the number of unencoded but useful ideographs is larger than originally anticipated, it is also finite and probably smaller 
		than the number of ideographs already encoded.  The bulk of useful unencoded forms is likely to come from placenames, personal names, or characters 
		needed for Chinese dialects other than Mandarin and Cantonese.  Many unencoded forms occurring in  existing texts are actually variants of encoded 
		characters and would best be represented as such.</p>
		<p class="a">While it currently takes several years for the IRG to fully process proposed ideographs so that they can be encoded, steps are being 
		taken to streamline this, and further steps will be possible in the future should they prove necessary.  Indeed, the bulk of the work currently 
		done by the IRG would still have to be done for composed ideographs in order to provide support for them beyond rendering. <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#JJ">[JJ]</a></p>
		
		<p class="q"><a name="17"></a>Q: Why does Unicode use the term "ideograph" when it is linguistically incorrect?</p>
		<p class="a">A: The characters used to write Chinese are traditionally called "Chinese characters" in the various East Asian languages (hanzi in Mandarin, kanji in Japanese and hanja in Korean). In English, they are generally referred to by names such as "ideograph" or "pictogram," even though these don't accurately reflect what the characters are or how they are used.  Indeed, no single linguistic term adequately describes these characters because they have such varied origins and uses.  The only possible exception would be "sinogram," which is Latin for "Chinese character" and rarely found.</p>
		<p class="a">Unicode originally adopted the word "ideograph" as representing common English usage. The term is now so pervasive in the standard that it cannot be abandoned. <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#JJ">[JJ]</a></p>
        <p class="q"><a name="18"></a>Q: What is the difference between the Unicode character properties "Ideographic" and "Unified_Ideograph"?
        </p><p class="a">A: The Unified_Ideograph property (short name: UIdeo) is used to specify the exact set of CJK Unified Ideographs in the standard. In other words, it is applied only to unified ideographs, and not to compatibility ideographs or other characters that behave like ideographs, and it is only used specifically for the CJK ideographs—characters in the Han script.</p>

<p class="a">The Ideographic property (short name: Ideo), on the other hand, is extended to all CJK ideographs—not just the unified ones. It also applies to certain characters, such as U+3007 IDEOGRAPHIC NUMBER ZERO, which behave like CJK ideographs, even though they are not formally considered part of the CJK Unified Ideographs. Furthermore, the Ideographic property is not constrained to apply only to Han script characters.</p>

<p class="q"><a name="19"></a>Q: What's the best way to find out how to pronounce an ideograph in Mandarin?</p>
<p class="a">A: Most Chinese characters have only one pronunciation in any given variety of spoken Chinese; and roughly half of those with multiple pronunciations have only one in general use. Exceptions are common enough, however, that text-to-speech engines dealing with extended runs of text had best take semantics and context into account when determining the correct pronunciations.</p>
<p class="a">In situations where sufficient context is unavailable, the best pronunciation to use with Mandarin is the one indicated with the kMandarin field. This is derived algorithmically from the kHanyuPinlu, kXHC1983, and kHanyuPinyin fields, with corrections and additions hand-supplied by experts in China. Where the kMandarin field provides multiple readings, the first is preferred for zh-Hans (CN) and the second is preferred for zh-Hant (TW). <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#JJ">[JJ]</a></p>

<p class="q"><a name="21"></a>Q: How does this relate to the pinyin ordering and transliteration in CLDR?</p>
<p class="a">A: The kMandarin field is used for pinyin ordering  and transliteration in CLDR.</p>

<p class="q"><a name="22"></a> Q: Why are DPRK (North Korean == kIRG_KPSource) glyphs missing from some CJK code charts?</p>
<p class="a">A: A font is not currently available for representation of kIRG_KPSource glyphs in the main CJK Unified Ideographs block, Ext A, and Ext B. It is possible that KP-Source glyphs will appear in future code charts, if suitable font data becomes available. <a href="https://unicode.org/faq/attribution.html#RC">[RC]</a></p>
